# FreelApp
**Essential Work App for Freelance**

FreelApp is a collaborative project born from a group of former Boolean students who came together to build a web application tailored for freelancers.
Over time, the project has evolved into an essential tool designed to make life easier for freelancers and professionals. FreelApp offers a clean and functional workspace to manage projects, clients, and track tasks efficiently.
With its built-in time tracker, you can monitor how long you spend on individual tasks or manually log work hours. Managing projects has never been simpler.
New features are constantly being added. FreelApp also allows you to track your earnings per project or task effortlessly. Each project can be set as budget-based, hourly, or based on total hours — and the system automatically calculates and updates all related data accordingly.
One of the coolest aspects? The statistics. They offer a comprehensive overview of your work progress, helping you analyze performance and revenue with key data to improve your workflow and grow your income.
